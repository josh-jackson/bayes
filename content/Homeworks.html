<h2>Homework protocol</h2>
<p>Each will be turned in via email to a box.com address specific to the take home. For each you will need to attach to the email 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. “Jackson_takehome1”) and include your name as part of the document front-/top-matter.</p>
<p>You may work together on each of these homeworks as long as everyone turns in a seperate file and understand EACH LINE OF CODE. If you do not understand then ask during class.</p>
